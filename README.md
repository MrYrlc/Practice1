# Practice1
Just do it for practice my c# ability（I just started learning code）
This is a useless project.Don't waste your time looking at my code.
I’ve just spent one month of my spare time learning the basics of C# by chatting with ChatGPT. Now, I’m trying to build a console-based player database.
(I know this kind of project may not be very useful, but the real purpose for me is to sharpen my C# skills.)
So far, I’ve only completed a few basic features. I’ll continue learning C# over the next few days and improve my code step by step.
