2025.5.4~2025.5.5:  Completed the initial framework and implemented basic functionality.
2025.5.6         :  Spent 4 hours adding input validation; still lots of bugs. Will fix and update tomorrow.
2025.5.7         :  Added input validation to ensure correct value ranges
2025.5.8         :  Updated the functionality to prevent adding duplicate players, and added support for modifying existing player information.

As of today, Iâ€™m shifting my focus to a new personal project, as the core functionality of this one is already well-developed. However, I will continue to maintain and improve this project over time.
